# EDA-and-Predicting-of-Booking-Status

In this project, I well analyze reservation data for Hotels, a chain of luxury hotels. I perform Exploratory and Explanatory  Data Analysis to understand the properties of the data, identify trends and patterns of reservation cancellations. I then build Machine Learning Algorithm (Classification models) for Predicting Booking Status into cancellations vs non-cancellations. These models can be used to predict the likelihood of cancellation for new reservations and allow the hotels to take actions accordingly.

The data contains information on over 40,000 reservations made from 2017 to 2018 years. For each reservation, we have information such as arrival/departure dates, reservation status ,avg price per room , room type reserved, etc. We find that certain dates, hotels, and customer segments have higher tendencies to cancel reservations. These insights can help Hotels craft targeted policies to prevent cancellations and improve customer experiences.
